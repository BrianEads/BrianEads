# About Me
- 👋 Hi, I’m @BrianEads. I'm currently leading the Global Digital Product Design group in Vegetable Seeds R&D for Bayer Crop Science. My background is in data science, genomics and analytics engineering.
# Professional Background
- 👀 I’m interested in data, machine learning and automation. My team deploys a wide array of tools in this space designed to accelerate breeding cycles with optimized genetic estimators, enable robotics and computer vision with image analysis and modeling, and augment human decisions with evaluation and decisions to speed time to market.
# Problem Domains
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about leveraging serverless patterns for our workloads, emerging paradigms such as edge computing for our field-based data collection from humans and sensors, and using bitwise arithmetic and hash tables to optimize expensive compute operations.
# Side Projects
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my hobbies, including archaeogenomics and Rasp-pi hacking (public repos to be posted).
# Contact
- 📫 You can reach me at bdeads@gmail.com.
